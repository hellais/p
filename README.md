# P, a simple shell project manager

The goal of p is to provide a quick way to switch between the working
directories of various different projects that you are currently on.

It currently is tested and works on python 2.7, bash and OSX. Other
configurations may have issues.

# Basic usage

Display the list of currently tracked projects:

`p`

Add a new project to keep track of:

`p add <project_name>`

or

`p add`

Change to the directory of a project:

`p <project_name>`
